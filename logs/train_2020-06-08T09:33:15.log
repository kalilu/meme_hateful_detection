2020-06-08T14:28:58 WARNING: /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.py:143: UserWarning: The epoch parameter in `scheduler.step()` was not necessary and is being deprecated where possible. Please use `scheduler.step()` to step the scheduler. During the deprecation, if epoch is different from None, the closed form is used instead of the new chainable form, where available.
